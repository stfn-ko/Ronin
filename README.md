# ðŸ”® Sorcero

Sorcero is a new programming language that is designed to make programming feel like magic. With its use of sorcery and witchcraft, Sorcero provides a unique and engaging learning experience. The language is built with a borrow checker, which ensures that code is free from memory errors, making it easier to create secure and reliable software. Sorcero's abstraction layer allows developers to focus on the logic of their code, rather than getting bogged down in the details. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out, Sorcero will help you create software that works like magic.
  

- ## Abstraction Layers
  Sorcero's abstraction layers provide developers with different levels of exposure to the more complex principles of the language, ranging from the novice level of "Apprentice" up to the expert level of "Archmage." This enables developers to work with a high-level interface that is closer to natural language, making it easier to write and maintain code, while also allowing them to work with more advanced features when required.
  The abstraction layers in Sorcero are a key feature that sets it apart from other programming languages. By providing a high-level interface, developers can create software that is more adaptable to changing needs and requirements, reducing the risk of errors and bugs. Whether you are a seasoned developer or just starting out, Sorcero will help you create software that works like magic.

- ## The Dark Side

  The "Dark Side" of Sorcero is a temptation that some developers find hard to resist. It refers to the ability to bypass the borrow checker and other safety features of the language and delve into the arcane depths of programming. The forbidden knowledge that lies beyond the safety rules can be alluring and powerful, but it also poses a risk of introducing memory errors and other bugs into your code. Only the most experienced and daring wizards should tread these dark paths, knowing full well the potential consequences of their actions.

# Sorcery Levels

Sorcero's magic can generally be subdivided into two categories: white sorcery and dark sorcery. While dark sorcery exposes developers to the dangers of unsafe programming, there are still abstraction layers within both. This way, the learning curve will be a lot more manageable for newbies and also let experienced developers smoothly transition into the language by getting familiar with the core concepts.

- ## White Sorcery

  White sorcery is the aspect of Sorcero that explores the sacred realms of programming, offering developers a path of enlightened understanding and bestowing upon them the wisdom to navigate through complex challenges while upholding the principles of safety and reliability. It guides them towards the light of optimal code, shielding them from the allure of forbidden practices that may lead to bugs and errors.

  - ### Novarion
    Novarion is the most basic level of Sorcero's white sorcery, providing a very high-level interface that allows developers to easily grasp the basics and start casting magic from the very first lines of code. It provides simple and intuitive capabilities that make it easy to learn and start building software that works like magic. The Novarion level of abstraction is accessed through the `nov::` namespace in Sorcero.

  - ### Solarius
    Solarius continues to provide a high-level interface like Novarion but introduces more complex functionality to concepts such as data structures and control flow statements. Instead of becoming something different it rather expands upon the functionality available in Novarion. The Solarius level of abstraction is accessed through the `sol::` namespace in Sorcero.

  - ### Alldivine
    Alldivine is the most advanced level of Sorcero's white sorcery, providing a highly customisable low-level interface that allows developers to have full control over the language and its features. The Alldivine level of abstraction is accessed through the `all::` namespace in Sorcero. Even though Alldivine is the highest level of white sorcery, it is still considered safe and not associated with the dark side of Sorcero. Alldivine wizards may have encountered aspects of darkness throughout their journey and may have even used some of the dark spells, but they are still considered experienced and skilled servers of light. With Alldivine, developers can create software that is highly optimised and efficient, making their code work like magic.

- ## Dark Sorcery
  Dark sorcery is the side of Sorcero that delves into the arcane depths of programming, tempting developers with forbidden knowledge that lies beyond the safety rules and exposing them to potential bugs and errors.

  - ### Neophyte
    The Neophyte level of abstraction in dark sorcery provides a basic understanding of the dark arts of programming and introduces developers to the more complex and dangerous features of the language. Although it is still considered relatively safe, it is important for aspiring dark sorcerers to exercise caution and restraint when working with this level of abstraction. The Neophyte is accessed through the `neo::` namespace in Sorcero.

  - ### Nocturnus
    Nocturnus is the intermediate level of abstraction in dark sorcery, providing developers with more advanced features and capabilities. As the name suggests, Nocturnus is associated with the dark and mysterious aspects of programming, exposing developers to the risks and rewards of the forbidden knowledge. The Nocturnus level is accessed through the `noc::` namespace in Sorcero.

  - ### Dominantus
    Dominantus is the highest level of abstraction in dark sorcery, providing developers with the ultimate power and control over the language and its features. The Dominantus level of abstraction is reserved for the most experienced and daring dark wizards, who have mastered the art of programming and are willing to take on the risks and challenges that come with it. The Dominantus level of abstraction is accessed through the `dom::` namespace in Sorcero.
